In this project, you will conduct a GWAS of coronary artery disease (CAD) using case-control data from the PennCATH study introduced in Assignment 3. Your assignment is to filter the SNP data using code from Steps 1-5 of the Reed et al (2015) workflow (Assignment 3), and then conduct a chi-square test (or 
Cochran-Armitage test; see below) of independence of dichotomized case-control status for each of the genotyped SNPs. You will then write a short report on your findings.

##### About the data

The data are from Reed et al. (2015) GWAS workflow from Assignment 3. In addition to HDL, LDL, and Triglyceride traits and genotypes for 1,401 human samples, the clinical data also include the case-control
status of coronary artery disease (CAD) which you will attempt map with the case-control GWAS approach.

##### Completing your assignment

If possible, use RStudio to create an Rmarkdown (.Rmd) file then use the Knit dropdown menu in RStudio to knit a .html report. Include in the .Rmd and .html files your code and any required figures embedded in your report after each question. If you prefer, you may submit all figures, text and code in an alternate format. Please upload the .Rmd and .html or .pdf files at the "Assignments" link on NYU Classes along with any other requested files such as the table with SNP information and association statistics.


##### Tasks

You will write an R script to conduct all analysis below.

The input files (including clinical phenotypes and SNP data for 1,401 samples), the GWAS_master.R script (introduced in Week 10 recitation), and accompanying files are available here:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17xLDCdv77gYwu55PEeGa6KJ3ZyRdolD1?usp=sharing

You will filter the SNPs and samples using the GWAS_master.R script as in assignment 3 using steps 1-5. You may use the "genotype" variable (a snpStat SnpMatrix object) at the end of Step 5 as the starting point for your case-control GWAS (the remainder of the script can be ignored). Please use the filtered SNPs and samples in your analysis, although if there are any samples with missing case-control status in the CAD column of the clinical phenotype data, you may also need to drop those samples from the genotype data.

Use the case-control status (in the CAD column of the file GWAStutorial_clinical.csv) (see Assignment 3) to perform the GWAS.

Calculate the Odds Ratio for each SNP. You may report either the allelic odds ratio or the homozygote odds ratio or both (see Pearson et al. 2008 Table 3)

You may conduct 2 x 2 or 2 x 3 Chi-square tests with 1 or 2 degrees of freedom as in Table 3 of Pearson et al. (2008) (e.g., using chisq.test function in base R) or you may conduct a Cochran-Armitage test as  performed by single.snp.tests function in the snpStats package.

Depending on how you conduct your analysis, you may find some useful approaches in the snpStats vignettes. For example, this vignette shows an approach for easily splitting cases and control genotypes followed by use of the snpStats col.summary function to get genotype frequencies at each SNP (which you can use to get genotype counts necessary for chi-square tests or odds ratio calculation)
https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/snpStats/inst/doc/snpStats-vignette.R

Hints:
If you decide to use chisq.test (?chisq.test), this function performs both contingency tests and good-of-fit tests, but you will want to do a contingency test. 

Hint: you can extract p-values and other info from output object using, for example, chisq.test(matrix(c(2,4,6,8)))$p.value. See ?chisq.test "Value" section for how to access different values from output object.

Here are the requirements for your report:

(1) A 1-2 page report with short introduction, methods, results, and discussion. The introduction and discussion can be minimal describing the case-control GWAS approach and highlighting key findings. The methods should be detailed summarizing all packages you used, the genotype and sample filtering approach from the Reed et al. workflow, a description of the statistics (including mention of Bonferroni correction and the significance threshold applied) and how you calculated the odds ratio. The results section should be detailed and include a description of the 10 most significant SNPs (reported in a table; see below).
(2) A table with the top 10 most significant SNPs, their rs number, the test statistic (e.g., chi-square value), their p-value (including whether they passed the Bonferroni significance threshold) the odds ratio for each SNP.
(3) Your discussion should comment on whether the any of the top 10 SNPs were also significant in your LDL analysis from Assignment 3. 
(4) A supplementary table with all SNPs in the GWAS analysis and a minimum of their rs number, test statistic and their P-value from the GWAS. Odds ratio could also be included for all SNPs in the supplementary table but is optional.
(5) An appendix with all your R code which should be detailed enough to reproduce all results.
